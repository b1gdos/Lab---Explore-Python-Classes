#### Part 2: Review Functions, Methods, and Classes
This part covers the distinction between functions and methods and introduces the basic structure of a class.

#### Part 3: Define a Function
Participants will define a function with arguments and then call it with different values.

#### Part 4: Define a Class with Methods
This part involves defining a class, using the `__init__()` function to define a method for the class, and creating instances of the class.

#### Part 5: Review the `circleClass.py` Script
